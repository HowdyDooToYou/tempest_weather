## Welcome
Use this thread to share feedback, ideas, and questions about **Tempest Air & Weather**.

## Current focus
- Hardened AQI-first layout and Tempest/AirLink data coverage.
- Connectivity is required (collectors, Streamlit client, AI/forecast calls).
- Forecasting capability exploration (GitHub Models) for temp/AQI/PM horizons.

## How to help
- Tell us what matters most: forecast horizon (24h/72h?), targets (temp, humidity, AQI, PM2.5).
- Report layout/usability issues (screenshots help).
- Suggest metrics or charts you want elevated in the UI.

## Next steps under consideration
- Add offline-safe overlay for forecasts (dashed lines + confidence bands).
- Optional alerts when AQI crosses thresholds.
- Small “forecast accuracy” view comparing recent forecasts vs actuals.

Drop your thoughts below. We'll iterate based on this thread.***

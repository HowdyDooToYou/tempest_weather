# Tempest Air & Weather kickoff: roadmap, feedback, and forecast plans

Welcome to **Tempest Air & Weather**! This thread is for roadmap updates, feedback, and ideas as we evolve the dashboard.

## What’s live now
- AQI-first layout with Tempest + AirLink data (outdoor) and dynamic sections.
- Trends/Comparisons tabs with reorderable charts and raw event explorers.
- Sidebar presets for quick time windows; connectivity is required for collectors and the client.

## What’s next
- **Forecasts**: add short-horizon predictions (temp, humidity, AQI/PM2.5) using GitHub Models-backed prototyping.
- **Alerts**: optional thresholds for AQI/PM (and maybe wind/rain bursts).
- **Layout polish**: keep AQI visuals prominent; simplify chart labels; refine spacing.
- **Data quality**: surface data coverage %, gaps, and last-update health at a glance.

## How to help
- Tell us your priority horizons (24h/72h?) and targets (temp, humidity, AQI, PM2.5).
- Share screenshots of layout issues or confusing bits.
- Suggest metrics/widgets you want elevated to the top.

Drop your thoughts below—this will guide what we ship next.***

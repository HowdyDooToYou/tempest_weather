# February 2, 2026: Radar + Freeze Alert UX Update

We just rolled a set of user-facing upgrades that make the Home page feel more alive and easier to read at a glance.

## Highlights

- Interactive radar section with past 2-hour loops and a next 2-hour forecast view.
- NOAA nowCOAST overlay layers (precip, snow, temperature, wind, lightning) with legends and saved preferences.
- Freeze alerts now track duration so the banner shows how long conditions have been active.
- Visual polish across cards and charts to improve contrast and reduce visual noise.

## Why It Matters

- Radar loops give immediate context for what is happening now and what is arriving soon.
- Overlay toggles let you tailor the map to the question you care about (snow vs wind vs lightning).
- Duration-aware freeze alerts reduce ambiguity during long cold snaps.

## What We Want Feedback On

- Are the radar overlays readable on your display?
- Which layers should be enabled by default?
- Any performance issues or missing controls you want to see next?

Drop thoughts in this discussion thread or open an issue with screenshots if you can.
